## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to install anything?
No. Just download and run. Both versions are self-contained.

### Are these apps safe?
Yes. They run entirely on your device. No data is sent anywhere. The source code is open for inspection.

### Why does antivirus/macOS warn about the app?
The apps are not digitally signed. This is common for open-source tools. The warnings are false positives.

### Can I use these on older OS versions?
- Windows: Windows 10 or later recommended
- macOS: 11 or later required
- For older versions, use the HTML GUI instead

### Do I need internet?
No. Both apps work completely offline.

### Where are my reports saved?
Default: `Documents/CEBT-Reports/`
You can change this when starting a test.
